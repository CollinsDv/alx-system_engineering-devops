# Debugging Web Stack - README

This repository contains the necessary files to debug and fix issues related to web stack configuration. The main focus is on two specific files: `0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp` and `1-user_limit.pp`.

## 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp

This file addresses the issue of the web server not being able to handle a large number of concurrent connections. By making the necessary adjustments to the server configuration, we can ensure that the web server can handle a higher load without any issues.

## 1-user_limit.pp

The `1-user_limit.pp` file deals with the problem of user limits on the web server. By modifying the relevant configuration settings, we can increase the maximum number of users that can access the server simultaneously.

Please refer to the respective files for detailed instructions on how to debug and fix these issues.
